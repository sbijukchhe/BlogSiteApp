            <p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web
            development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms,
            buttons, navigation and other interface components.
            </p>
            <p>
            Bootstrap is the third-most-starred project on GitHub, with more than 131,000 stars, behind only
            freeCodeCamp (almost 300,000 stars) and marginally behind Vue.js framework.[2] According to Alexa Rank,
            Bootstrap getbootstrap.com is in the top-2000 in US while vuejs.org is in top-7000 in US.
            Build responsive, mobile-first projects on the web with the worldâ€™s most popular front-end component
            library.

                Bootstrap is a web framework that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages
                (as opposed to web apps). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's
                choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the
                developers in charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides
                basic style definitions for all HTML elements. The end is a uniform appearance for prose, tables and
                form elements across web browsers. In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS classes defined in
                Bootstrap to further customize the appearance of their contents. For example, Bootstrap has provisioned
                for light- and dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes, and text with
                a highlight.
